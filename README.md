## üìå Overview

This project develops a digital twin-based system that enhances pedestrian safety at urban traffic intersections. The system integrates smart city infrastructure, machine learning-based trajectory forecasting, and real-time communication between infrastructure and mobile users.

## üèó System Components

- **Object Detection & Tracking:**  
  Real-time detection and tracking using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack on video feeds from high-mounted COSMOS cameras.

- **Trajectory Prediction:**  
  Transformer-based models predict future positions of vehicles and pedestrians.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Estimation:**  
  Collision risks are calculated using predicted trajectories and TTC thresholds.

- **MQTT Communication:**  
  Vehicle and pedestrian data are transmitted using the MQTT protocol to client devices.

- **Mobile Warning App:**  
  A smartphone app receives data and alerts pedestrians of potential collisions via UI and vibration/audio cues.

- **CARLA Simulation (optional):**  
  Digital twin implementation in CARLA for virtual testing and hardware-in-the-loop validation.
